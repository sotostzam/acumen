Sequence of examples of Zeno systems
------------------------------------

These exmaples illustrate how we can use an enclosure 
based solver to simulate Zeno systems. Usually getting 
good simulation results involves three steps:

  1 Simulate the model in its original formulation.
    
  2 Add knowledge about the system using invariants,
    captured by the require clause, in order to 
    improve the size of the enclosure.
  
  3 Vary the simulator parameters to further improve 
    the size of the enclosure. At this stage the 
    enclosure can get small enough to provide a good 
    picture of how the system behaves before and after 
    the Zeno point. It is often best to vary simulator 
    parameters only in the last step because it can 
    cause the simulation times to take a lot longer.

The example models are variations of four systems.

 - The simplest possible Zeno system. Nicely demonstrates 
   the effect of adding an invariant and the localization 
   time step parameter.

 - A slightly more complicated model, where imagining 
   the post-Zeno behavior is already challenging. 
   By following the procedure – adding an invariant, 
   tweaking the parameters - we can see that the system 
   is not stable after Zeno.

 - A system which has stable (even convergent) post-Zeno 
   dynamics. In this case adding a simple invariant is not 
   enough to prove this, the enclosure after Zeno diverges 
   in the first model. Here, in the second model, adding 
   a helper variable and expressing an invariant in terms 
   of it gives a small enclosure after Zeno.

 - The bouncing ball finally demonstrates the procedure 
   used for the Two Tanks model on a system with a non-
   linear ODE solution. In this case, the convergence 
   after Zeno is fast enough to be clearly visible.
