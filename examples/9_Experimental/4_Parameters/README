Examples illustrating simulator parameters
------------------------------------------

These exmaples illustrate how simulator parameters affect 
simulation results. The examples are grouped according to 
the specific simulator parameter they illustrate.

 - simulator.minSolverStep
   This parameter is the smallest segment of time over which
   model ODEs will be solved. For models with constant
   fields, this can be set equal to the simulation end time.
   For models with nonconstant fields, setting this to a 
   lower value can shrink the enclosure, at the cost of an 
   increased simulation time. The value of this parameters
   must be positive.

 - simulator.minLocalisationStep
   This parameter is the smallest segment of time over which
   event localisation will happen. Setting this to a lower 
   value makes it possible to more precisely determine the 
   time at which an event occurred. This can translate to an
   overall improvement in the size of the enclosure, at the 
   cost of an increased simulation time. The value of this
   parameter must be greater or equal to minSolverStep.

   07_minLocalisationStep_Many_Events.acm
   08_minLocalisationStep_Many_Events_Small.acm
   
 - simulator.minComputationImprovement
   This parameter is a measure of the amount of improvement
   necessary for the algorithm to continue improving the 
   enclosure. A lower value can give a smaller enclosure, at
   the cost of an increased simulation time. The value of this 
   parameter must be nonnegative. Setting this parameter to 
   zero effectively disables it, meaning that the size of 
   enclosures depends on the values of the remaining parameters.
