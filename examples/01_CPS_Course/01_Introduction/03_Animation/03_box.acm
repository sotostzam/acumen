// A box goes wild

model Main(simulator) = 
initially
  t   =  0 & // Local time
  t'  =  1 & // Is as fast as global time
 _3D  =  ()
always
  t' = 1 &
  _3D = 
  (Box 
     center=(0,0,0)       // Center point
     size=(0.2,t/2+0.1,3-t/4) // Size        
     color=red 
     rotation=(0,0,0))
 

// Exercises
// 1) Does the box rotate during the animation?
// 2) Display the area of the surface that changes
//    size during the animation
