/* Exercise:
 * Modify the above controller to dampen the system 
 * by taking into account the speed of the mass 
 * in addition to its position. You can use the variable x� 
 * on the right hand-side of the equation for x initially.  
 * However, keep in mind that x cannot magically appear inside a digital computer.  
 * To address this problem, your final model should include a method 
 * for computing an estimate of speed based only on the value of the variable sensor.
