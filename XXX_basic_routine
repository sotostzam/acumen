If you have direct access to the acumen-dev fork, the basic
routine that you would typically follow to send your changes to
the repository would be basically as described below.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary:  ADD, COMMIT, PULL, then PUSH, in that order!
 
          How to switch to another branch and get back, safely.

          Note:  Repositories are described in the file XXX_main_workflow

---------------------------------------------------------------------

ADD

In general, it's a good thing to check the status of your clone
before doing anything with the rep.  That is done by typing:

  git status

Then, to stage the changes in your clone so that they can be committed
to your shared rep on gitfhub, you execute the following command:

  git add -u ./

If you have added new files that you'd like to put in the rep, then 
you need to add them one by one, as follows:

  git add FILE

If you have a new directory with some files in it, clean it up and
make sure it only contains things that you want to committ, and then
you can say

  git add directory-name

Do a "git status" again.  Any files you changes will be under "Changed
but not updated", you should add those also assuming they are part of
the updated arithmetic operators.  Everything that is to be committed
should be under "Changes to be committed".  Make sure anything under
another category is something you don't want to add.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

COMMIT

What you just did is known as "staging" the changes. Now you can
commit them.  Just use:

  git commit

and hopefully the emacs editor will come up.  Please type a useful
commit message describing your changes.  As an innocent suggestion,
since you don't have a working spell checker, maybe you can type the
message in an editor that does spellcheck and copy and paste them into
emacs.  (Just reformat them using ESC q).

Now see you changes by doing a:

  git log --stat

which should show you commit.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

PULL

If you need to get the latest version, just do this:

  git pull --no-edit

After doing a PULL, make sure the word "conflict" did not appear in
the output of that operation.  If there is a conflict, talk to Kevin
right away!  If there is no conflict, do "git status" and make sure
there are no "C"onflict markers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

PUSH

Once that is done do a:

  git push

And let me know when that done and I will review the changes, and if
there is a problem I will let you know.  If not I will merge them into
acumen-e/devel-e.

How to switch to another branch and get back, safely.

If you have a prompt that indicates what branch you are on, this helps.
Adam has a good .profile for doing that.

The basic rountine for swtiching to another branch and getting back
is as follows:

  git stash                   ## Saves any unsaved work on initial/current branch
  git checkout lohner         ## Here "lohner" is the name of the other branch
  git ...                     ## Work as usual
  git push -u origin lohner   ## Pushes just to that branch
  git checkout master         ## Here "master" is what you worked on initially
  git stash pop               ## Brings back any unsaved work on initial branch
  git status                  ## Just a sanity check
