Acumen Socket Interface
=======================

The socket interface is provided with Acumen to allow users to
run an Acumen simulation in cooperation with another simulation.
The socket connection sends the entire state back and forth
between Acumen (working as a server) to the other program (working
as a client).  The client can read and modify any part of the
entire state before sending it back.

Using the interface requires running Acumen in the command line
mode.  The following command line syntax can be used to start
Acumen in this mode (as a server):

  java -jar acumen-10-devel.jar <acumen-model-file> listen <port>

As a concrete example, you may type:

  java -jar acumen-10-devel.jar examples/3_Hybrid_Systems/bouncing_ball_3d.acm listen 5000

to start Acumen running the file bouncing_ball_3d.acm and communicating
over port 5000.

Acumen sends and reads back the data in JSON format.

After starting the server in this mannter, Acumen will wait (block) 
for a client to connect to that same port. Currently we also provide
in this directory sample echo clients written in Java and OCaml.
In what follows we will illustrate how those clients can be used.

Java Client Usage (Originally by Cherif Salama and/or Angela Yun Zhu)
=================

This client requires having Java JDK installed.

From the root Acumen source directory, do:

   cd socket/client-examples/java/echoclient/
   make

alternatively you can just type:

  javac EchoClient.java

To start the client, make sure that the Acumen server is running and
listening for a client on a certain port. To start the client:

   java EchoClient <server-ip> <server-port>

For example if the Acumen server is running on the same machine and
waiting on port 5000 do:

   java EchoClient 127.0.0.1 5000


OCaml Client Usage (Originally by Cherif Salama and/or Angela Yun Zhu)
==================

This client requires having OCaml installed.

From the root Acumen source directory, do:

   cd socket/client-examples/ocaml/echoclient/
   make

To start the client, make sure that the Acumen server is running and
listening for a client on a certain port. To start the client:

   ./echo_client <server-ip> <server-port>

For example if the Acumen server is running on the same machine and
waiting on port 5000 do:

   ./echo_client 127.0.0.1 5000
