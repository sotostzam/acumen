The goal of this algorithm is to extract a H.A. from a single object
model with with arbitrary nested ifs and switches.  

Requirements:

In addition to a restricted syntax this algo. also assumes the new
semantics and no sequential conditional actions (ifs or switches)

Notes:

  discr = discrete
  cont  = continuous

(abbreviations markers are not used, eventually they should just be
expanded once the algo. is close to something that should be in a
paper)

EXTRACT SIMULATOR PARMS)

Remove any assignments to simulator parameters at the top level and
note them.

SPLIT)

  Split the AST into discrete and continuous phases.  Insert NoOps
  when necessary.

TRANSFORM)

  For the cont phase:

  a) switches become if with a special if to handle the case when non
     of the cases match

  b) unguarded assignments (both continuous and discrete) iteratively
     get moved into deeper nested ifs, if necessary introduce else
     clauses
     FIXME: What does unguarded mean -- kevina

  for example
  
       a := 10
       if (...)
         b := 10
       end
       c := 30

    becomes

       if (...)
         a := 10
         b := 20
         c := 30
       else
         a := 10
         c := 30

  c) if there are still any ';' seperating anything but assignments
     FAIL

  d) else clauses become nots ie:

       if (A) ...
       else

     becomes

       if (A) ...
       if (!A) ...

  e) Flatten nested ifs by combining predicates.

      if (A)
        if (B)
        if (!B) 
      if (!A)
        if (C)

     becomes

       if (A && B)
       if (A && !B)
       if (!A && C)

CONVERT TO MODES)

  Give each cont if a label ("C1", "C2", "C3" etc.) and perform the
  following conversion:

  Convert:

  if (A && B) 
    x' = ...
    y' = ...
  end

to

  if ($mode == "C1")
    x' = ...
    y' = ...
  end

  if (A && B)
    $mode = "C1"
  end

  Each continuous if is now the bases for a mode.

  The new descrite ifs should be considered part of the discr phase
  for the rest of this algo.

TRANSFORM DISCR)

  Perform the same steps in the TRANSFORM step but for the discr phase.

  Each discr if is now a reset/event

ADD RESETS AND SPECIAL MODES)
  
  For all the discr ifs that do not contain a discrete assignment to
  $mode, add the following discrete assignment: '$mode := "D0"'.
  
  Copy all discr if into a body of a new 'if $mode == "D0"' block and
  also into the body of all cont ifs.

  Add a private variable declaration '$mode := "D0"'.

  Each if is now the basis for a mode and we now have a Hybrid
  Automaton.

CONVERT TO SWITCH)

Convert the modes into a switch

FIX UP)

Put back any assignments to simulator paramaters on the top level
